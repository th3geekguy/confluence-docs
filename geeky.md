Headings are great for titles and subtitles.

## Emphasis

You can emphasize text using *italics*, **bold**, or ***both***.

- *I'm italicized like a variable in math.*
- **I'm bold like a statement from Sheldon Cooper.**
- ***I'm both because why not!***

## Lists

## Links

## Images

Adding images is easy. Here's a picture of a cute cat because who doesn't love cats?

## Blockquotes

Blockquotes are great for quoting text, like a wise philosopher or a favorite character.

> "Do or do not, there is no try." - Yoda

## Code

Inline code is useful for short snippets like `printf("Hello, World!");`.

For longer blocks of code, use triple backticks:

```python
# Python code example
def calculate_mean(numbers):
    total = sum(numbers)
    count = len(numbers)
    return total / count

numbers = [42, 1337, 3.14159]
mean = calculate_mean(numbers)
print("The mean is", mean)
```

## Tables

Tables are useful for organizing information neatly.

| Character        | Universe     | Quote                               |
| ---------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Spock            | Star Trek    | "Live long and prosper."            |
| The Doctor       | Doctor Who   | "I'm the Doctor. Just the Doctor."  |
| Hermione Granger | Harry Potter | "It's Levio-sa, not Levio-sa."      |

## Conclusion

This is just the tip of the iceberg. Markdown is powerful and fun, especially when you combine it with nerdy humor.

Remember:

```markdown
# Stay nerdy, stay funny!
```

And always:
> "42 is the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything."
